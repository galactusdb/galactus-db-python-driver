# Galactus DB drivers

Seven native **database drivers**, with a shared API and zero third-party runtime
packages. Version **0.2.0** is early access. All seven source repositories are
public under [galactusdb](https://github.com/galactusdb), with `main` as the default
branch. Registry packages have not been published; install from source using the
language Quickstart and pin a reviewed commit. Each driver speaks **Bolt 5.0 to
5.4** directly and falls back to **Bolt 4.4** when the server offers only that. Each uses its host language directly and needs neither a helper runtime nor
the server source at runtime.

Use **driver** for package names and public APIs. Use **SDK** for a future wider
bundle containing drivers, administration tools, examples, and integrations.

## Shared developer experience

1. Open a driver with a URI, username, password, and optional database/timeout.
2. Execute parameterised Cypher using `execute_query` / `executeQuery` /
   `ExecuteQuery`, following the language's conventions.
3. Read `records` by column name and retain `keys` and `summary` metadata.
4. Use `begin`, `commit`, and `rollback` for explicit transactions.
5. Close/dispose the driver; closing an open transaction rolls it back on the
   server. Rust and C++ also close on destruction.
6. Read the agreed `protocol_version`, `server_agent`, `connection_id` and
   `last_bookmark` from the driver (in each language's naming).

No generated models, ORM, schema registration, JSON conversion, or special
integer class is needed for ordinary values. Parameter values are encoded
recursively, and returned values are hydrated recursively, including spatial
values inside graph properties and nested containers.

Database integers are signed 64-bit. Node returns **native `bigint`**, while
JavaScript `number` parameters encode as floating point. Other languages use
their native signed integer representations. Out-of-range integers fail rather
than being truncated. Unknown wire structures remain explicit structures.

Nodes and relationships expose string element ids (`elementId()` text); on Bolt
4.4 the drivers fill them from the integer id. Offset datetimes use the protocol's
own tag (`I` on 5.x, `F` on 4.4), and named-zone datetimes record whether their
seconds are local or UTC. `DECIMAL` values arrive as exact strings; Python, Java
and C# also send their standard decimal type as exact plain text.

See [the blueprint and mapping table](BLUEPRINT.md) for exact semantics and
[the spatial contract](SPATIAL.md) for geometry/geography handling.

## All supported spatial types

Every driver has `Point2D`, `Point3D`, and a native `Spatial` value preserving
WKB bytes plus domain, SRID, XY/XYZ layout, and model. This covers Point,
LineString, Polygon with holes, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon,
GeometryCollection, nested collections, and typed empties in both geometry and
geography.

The database's versioned envelope is used without coordinate rewriting or
conversion through GeoJSON. Bind a `Spatial` value directly, then use
`spatial.fromMap($shape)` in Cypher to turn that envelope into a database shape.
This explicit promotion is required by the existing server protocol.

## Scope of 0.2

These are small **single-connection, eager-result drivers**. One connection is
owned by each driver. Use a separate driver for each concurrent unit of work,
especially transactions. Go, Java and C# serialize calls; Node rejects overlapping
operations; Python and C++ must not be shared concurrently; Rust requires mutable
access. There is no connection pool, routing discovery, automatic retry,
managed transaction callback, lazy cursor, ORM, or async API outside Node yet.

`bolt://` is direct TCP. `bolt+s://` is verified TLS, with the URI host name
used for SNI and the certificate check. A Galactus server started with
`GDB_TLS_CERT` and `GDB_TLS_KEY` terminates TLS itself on the same port and then
requires it. Python, Node, Go, Java and C# use their standard TLS libraries;
Rust (cargo feature `tls`) and C++ (CMake option `GALACTUS_WITH_TLS`) add TLS as
an opt-in build so the default build keeps zero dependencies. Every driver
accepts an optional trusted-certificate file that replaces the platform store,
for private CAs and self-signed development servers. There is no option to skip
verification, and no driver silently downgrades TLS.

Messages are limited to 64 MiB and nesting to 64 levels. Query results are eager
and may collectively exceed one message; use Cypher `LIMIT` for large queries.
I/O timeouts default to 30 seconds. They bound socket waits (Go uses a deadline
for the complete operation), not total DNS resolution or every query's total
elapsed time. After a database error the driver sends RESET, marks any open
transaction as rolled back, raises the error and stays usable. Protocol, I/O,
TLS and authentication failures discard the connection; open a new driver after
those. A transport failure during COMMIT is an **unknown commit outcome**; the
drivers never automatically replay a write.

Database errors keep the server code and message and add classification,
category and title, plus client/transient/database flags and `is_retryable`
(transient errors only). The published Galactus error codes are constants in
every driver. Routing, session re-authentication and telemetry are not part of
0.2.

Returned graph entities are result-only database types; bind their IDs or
properties rather than the entities. Arbitrary application objects and UUIDs
are not implicitly converted. Convert them explicitly to a
supported representation. Use unique result aliases when reading record maps.

## Verification

[Test instructions](../tests/README.md) describe the shared golden wire fixtures,
malformed-input tests, and isolated real-server runner. Every language has been
compiled/executed locally against a freshly built Galactus server, three times:
on Bolt 5.4, on a server capped at Bolt 4.4, and over the server's own TLS with a
throwaway test CA. The common spatial fixture has 57 cases per language, including
both domains, XY/XYZ, empties, holes, nested collections, and antimeridian
geography. Shared Bolt 5 and datetime-pair fixtures pin the version-specific wire
forms.

Platform validation so far is Windows. Linux/macOS builds, pooling under load,
cancellation and production hardening remain release work. Speaking Bolt 5 does
not by itself make these drivers production ready.
